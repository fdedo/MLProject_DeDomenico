This repository contains all the files related to the Machine Learning Project, as it can be found in the Google Drive folder[1] 
_Notebook_sentimentanalysis.ipynb_ is loaded.


There are four files related to data, two of which are more general (_License.txt_ and _description.txt_) and four different datasets (_Sentences_#Agree.txt_), with a zip version. As explained in the notebook, the dataset with 50% of agreement has been adopted in the project. 

Other files (_all-data.csv_, _data.csv_, _prepro_data.csv_) contains respectively a first and processed versions of data, as used in the project.

You can find an npy file for the embedding part _(embedding_matrix.npy_), while _vocabulary.txt_ helps in the implementation of the code. 

There are two files for the adopted architectures, one is about _CNN_ and one about_ RNN_.
